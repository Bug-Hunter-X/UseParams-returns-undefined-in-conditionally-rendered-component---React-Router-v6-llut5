In React Router Dom v6, a common issue arises when using the `useParams` hook within a component that's rendered conditionally or lazily.  If the component isn't immediately rendered, `useParams` might return `undefined` or incorrect values initially, causing errors or unexpected behavior. This typically happens because `useParams` relies on the routing state, which might not be fully available at the time of the component's initial mount.
